This is a new document that wasn't originally in the 
"Spoon-Knife" repository. 

This file is found on main, but the rest of the information it contains
can only be found on the "dev1" branch.

git branch --> Shows you what your current branch looks like

git branch <New branch name> --> Creates a new branch (Locally)

git checkout <branch name> --> Change your current branch into 
this one, so that all commits made under this branch remain only here.

If you want to see a locally made branch show up in the remote repo.,
make sure to checkout the new branch, add & commit, and then push
it to the repo (Ex: git push origin dev1)
