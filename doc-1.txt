This is a new document that wasn't originally in the 
"Spoon-Knife" repository.

git clone --> Get your own copy of the repository by copying and pasting "git@github.com:zDoctrov/Spoon-Knife.git"

git add --> "Stages files", making them a part of the next commit you make

By using the "git add ." to affect every new file or the "git add doc-1.txt" 
to effect only the doc-1.txt file, we have staged the file to be committed.

Staging is required before committing your changes to the main repository, as 
it separates logically unrelated edits.

for example, if you have 4 files fileA.html, fileB.html, fileC.html, and fileD.html
and files A & B are closely related and both completed at the same time before files C & D,
You'd want to commit changes pertaining to only A & B:
git add fileA.html
git add fileB.html
git commit -m "Implemented new feature XYZ"

Only after you complete C & D afterwards would you want to consider staging
them to be a part of the next commit
git add fileC.html
git add fileD.html
git commit -m "Implemented another feature EFG"

git commmit -m "Added README.md" --> Finally makes the changes made into a concrete iteration.


git push origin [branch name] -->
