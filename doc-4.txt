git log --> Allows you to see all previously made commits

git merge <branchName> --> Merges the branch detailed in the command
		with the current branch.

Having to merge branches to get the most up-to-date version
of the software is a commmon version management task, especially when
managing the work of multiple users.

One of the problems you'll come across while trying to merge branches
is a conflict, where both branches are missing something that the other
has.

To deal with a conflict, delete all the stuff auto-generated by git
(<<<HEAD, ====, >>>>>><branchName>) and makes edits to the file
that merge the two branches seamlessly.

Use git add and git commit, no message is needed for the commit
in this case.

And finally you'll see a scary looking screen with a lot of information.
Ignore that stuff for now, and press "shift + colon" and type 
"wq" and hit enter to tell git that your edited version of the merger
is okay and it can go ahead with the commit.
